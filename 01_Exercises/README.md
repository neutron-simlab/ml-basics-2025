To run the first exercise you will need the data file which is to large to be stored in git. Here is the link to the cloud to download this file:
```
https://iffcloud.fz-juelich.de/s/aZ9daMgN998fabM
```
Pay attention to put this file to the `data` folder or to adjust the path to the file in jupyter notebook. 

I will cloise this link a couple of weeks after the tutorial. If you will need to download this file later, please send me an email.
